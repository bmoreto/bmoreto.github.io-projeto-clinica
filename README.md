# Patient Management System

This project was developed as part of the **second semester of the Systems Analysis and Development program**.  
The system allows patient registration, displays statistics, enables searching, and manages a service queue.

The front-end interface was built based on the principles, techniques, and best practices taught in **Origamid courses**, prioritizing:

- A clean and responsive layout 
- Clear and organized forms  
- A consistent and intuitive design
